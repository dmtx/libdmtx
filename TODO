  o Add what we currently do, don't do, would like to do in the future
  o Add http://hosted-projects.com/trac/hudora/public/wiki/huBarcode to resources page


Proposed Change: Modularity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Make finder bar detection pluggable so a separate future version can be
made for dot peen pattern detection (remaining steps would be unchanged).


Proposed Change: Image Scaling
-----------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * still on the fence whether image scaling factors should be maintained in
 * DmtxDecode ... but right now leaning that way. Thinking goes that any
 * caching will be tied to scale, and scale change should not affect image
 * object. Basically, load the image once and then don't touch it anymore.
 *
 * However, I also want to be able to say:
 *
 *    offset = dmtxImageGetOffset(img, x, y)
 *
 * ... and have the result take scaling into account. This statement really
 * has nothing to do with the decoding process (and therefore decode struct).
 * hmmm ...
 */
typedef struct DmtxDecode_struct {
   int scale;
   int xMin;
   int xMax;
   int yMin;
   int yMax;
   int xMinScaled;
   int xMaxScaled;
   int yMinScaled;
   int yMaxScaled;
} DmtxDecode;


Proposed Change: Region Detection
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The first edge is currently detected using fixed-offset Hough
transform. This is very efficient for the first edge, but forces
all remaining traces to perform additional Hough transforms for
unsuccessful region candidates because we can't say with
certainty: "This previously-tested pixel location does not belong
to a barcode region." This is because it may have been part of a
barcode region but the trail was blazed starting from a non-
finder-bar location so it was ditched when the fixed-offset Hough
transform did not produce a good line.

A better approach might be:

  1) Blaze trail in both directions
  2) Walk entire trail to size the Hough bounding box
  3) Walk entire trail to accumulate Hough lines
     - Can be fast/low-res search since we will tighten later if
       it continues to be a promising candidate
     - Consider overlapping Hough regions to avoid near-border
       confusion and complexity later
  4) Extract 2 best Hough lines (use right angle + convex hull)
  5) Determine region polarity and orientation
  6) etc... (see "Region Calibration" below)

Although more costly for the first detected region, this approach
allows future scans to skip all pixels that have been traversed
previously. This should translate to significant time savings,
especially for noisy and complex images.


Proposed Change: Region Calibration
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The current calibration technique relies solely on points and
angles found during the Hough process, and uses the calibration
bar only to detect symbol size. A more robust approach might take
advantage of the calibration bars' repeating pattern to extract
precise edge locations for the adjacent edges. Doing so will
provide extremely accurate symbol regions since each of the 4
edges will contain a precise anchor point instead of relying on a
potentially fuzzy edge measurement. This will also help with
barcodes created using undersized/oversized printing process.

Continuing from above:

  6) Blaze gapped trail for both calibration bars
     - After this, the basic region shape is known
     - Final trail should be a contiguous trail that is easy to
       follow in either direction, although gapped lines may be
       stored differently as to leave original trail intact
     - Future version might try one at a time for improved
       handling of damaged regions)
  7) Detect symbol size using jump tally approach
  8) Find exact edge locations using Bresenham/Hough approach to
     measure offset and scaling? (super accurate because cosine
     of small angles approaches zero)
  9) Execute final high-res Hough transform on each edge, using
     known points as anchors
     - After this, the precise region shape is known
     - Must use multiple offsets. Best Hough line may not run
       through anchor because we can't assume that our edge-
       finding algorithm necessarily runs along the perfect edge,
       just that it follows the edge consistently. This process
       will simply provide the ideal angle to use.

Step 8 details: While stepping along pixels on Bresenham line we
always know whether we are sitting on the primary or secondary
color. The Hough transform will store a 2D array of bracketed
scalings and offsets, which we will increment if our actual color
matches the predicted array element color. After traversing the
line once, we will know the exact scaling and offset.

This approach uses a fast-and-rough fit followed by a high
precision fit. While it would be convenient if we could capture
everything in one pass, this approach offers some significant
advantages:

  * Regions that turn out to be bad are filtered out early in the
    process before spending much time on them
  * Fast-and-rough fit requires less memory
  * Allows for simpler logic; Not trying to do too much at once
  * Programs that do their own rough region detection can still
    use libdmtx high precision fit
  * High precision fit should apply equally well to contiguous-
    edge and dot peen symbols


Proposed Change: Latest thoughts on region detection
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Allocate memory cache, one byte per pixel

  bits: cuuutddd
        --------
        12345678

  c = connected edge flag
  u = upstream direction
  t = meets min threshold flag
  d = downstream direction

* Step through entire image and assign best downstream neighbor if above certain
  threshold. (sets t and d bits)

* Step through grid locations looking for edge candidates:

* If below threshold (t == 0) OR
  if edge was connected in a previous step (c == 1)
  then skip to next

* Follow the edge upstream and downstream, leaving connected trails both upstream
  and downstream. This should follow the existing downstream directions, but may
  involve assigning new downstream directions to unpopulated locations in order
  to bridge any small gaps. At each location, mark c = 1 and u = upstream direction.
  If necessary, u == d can indicate special case (trail end?) since this can't
  occur naturally otherwise.

* If connected trail is short then skip to next

* Step along connected trail and form bounding box limits

* If bounding box is small then skip to next

* Step along connected trail to measure finder bars using Hough Transform

* If Hough lines look stupid then skip to next

* Align/Transform region based on finder bars

* Run Boundary Hough on entire interior "L" region. Use Hough orientation based
  on direction being scanned. For example, when looking for horizontal vanishing
  point, optimize for horizontal lines, and take into account the region polarity.
  This might make it clean enough for dot peen detection using the same approach.

* Extract horizontal and vertical vanishing points

* Align/Transform region based on vanishing points

* Find limits in orthagonal region

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation strategy:

1) Confirm that "L" extraction works using Ordinary Hough
   - Use Ordinary Hough because edge is not jagged and interior is unknown

2) Change trunk to use above cache storage layout, but not changing
   approach yet. Also move cache to DmtxDecode. Prepopulate downstream
   neighbors?

3) Change trunk to use "L" extraction above
   - emphasis on angle instead of offset
   - overlap offsets to avoid split condition
   - use convex hull
   - use right angles
   - determine polarity

4) Implement fast multi-scanning (skip previously-visited locs)

Release 0.7

5) Confirm that Boundary Hough concept works
   - test on all conditions
   - Boundary Hough needs to use color polarity
   - Boundary Hough needs to use interior direction

6) Confirm that vanishping point detection works
   - use Boundary Hough
   - test for vanishing points
   - test for dot peen

7) Change trunk to detect vanishing point with Boundary Hough
   - can pattern also be detected with this approach?

8) Align/transform based on vanishing point

9) Detect solid black and solid white bars

10) Tight fit based on repeating calibration pattern


For Release 0.8
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  byte 1:  pntflow
          --------
             0-255

  byte 2: xcuuuddd
          --------
          12345678

  c = connected edge flag
  u = upstream direction
  d = downstream direction

Ordinary Hough test:

for each color channel:
   allocate image and image cache (2 bytes per pixel)
   assign point flow for each pixel (byte 1), and 3 bits for direction

   offset = y * img->width + x;
   colorPattern[0] = img->pxl[(offset - img->width - 1) * 3];
   colorPattern[1] = img->pxl[(offset - img->width    ) * 3];
   colorPattern[2] = img->pxl[(offset - img->width + 1) * 3];
   colorPattern[3] = img->pxl[(offset              + 1) * 3];
   colorPattern[4] = img->pxl[(offset + img->width + 1) * 3];
   colorPattern[5] = img->pxl[(offset + img->width    ) * 3];
   colorPattern[6] = img->pxl[(offset + img->width - 1) * 3];
   colorPattern[7] = img->pxl[(offset              - 1) * 3];

   write out pnm dump 1
   connect edges downstream, leaving trail

   - pick starting loc where downstream points back (how to measure this?)

*** in a river, you know you are in the center of the stream when your ***
*** neighbor on each side is moving slower than you                    ***

   - follow outward, leave upstream trail
   - pick next loc by choosing strongest of 5 neighbors that do not reverse
     course
   - follow outward, leave upstream trail
   - repeat
   connect edges upstream, leaving trail
   - do reverse of above
   - store the final upstream jump, to be used as starting point for walks
   write out pnm dump 2
   step along trail to build bounding box
   step along trail to accumulate Hough sums
   write out pnm dump 3 representing Hough sums
   write out pnm dump 4 with Bresenham lines drawn along all winning edges

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Boundary Hough test:

increment line
decrement interior line

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Vanishing Point detection:

Known:
  "L" alignment edge location

Approach:
  1) Sample each pixel in a parallelogram formed by the "L" edges
     and implied opposing parallel edges
  2) Sample each pixel within region exactly once
  3) Perform Boundary Hough test twice, once for each edge of "L"
     to define interior direction
  4) Detect interior edges as pattern of points in Hough grid
  5) 2 skew tranforms should be sufficient to correct any
     perspective distortion
  6) Find calibration edges and extract exact edge locations

Note: Initial implementation may use regular Hough if much simpler

               libdmtx README file (all platforms)

This summary of the libdmtx package applies generally to all
platforms. For instructions regarding your specific platform
please also read the README.xxx file in this directory that
matches your system (e.g., README.linux, README.cygwin,
README.osx, README.visualc, etc...).


1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing Data
Matrix barcodes of the modern ECC200 variety. It runs on several
platforms and provides bindings for a variety of languages. At
its core libdmtx is a shared library, allowing C/C++ programs to
use its capabilities without restrictions or overhead.

The included utility programs provide the official command line
interface for libdmtx, and serve as a good reference for
programmers who wish to write their own programs that interact
with libdmtx. This software is distributed with the LGPL license
and can be used freely under those terms.


2. Package Components
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx serves a diverse audience and contains many components,
some of which may not be useful to you. Components fall into one
of four categories:

  * Core library      (useful to all libdmtx users)
  * Utility programs  (useful to command line users)
  * Test programs     (useful to libdmtx developers)
  * Language Wrappers (useful to non-C/C++ developers)

The default installation will compile and install the core
library and all three command line utilities. The test programs
are compiled by running an additional "make check", and the
language wrappers are built using instructions found in their
specific directories.

Users who only want the core library can disable the command line
utilities by passing the following parameters to "configure"
during installation:

  --disable-dmtxread
  --disable-dmtxwrite
  --disable-dmtxquery

This eliminates most software dependencies and helps to reduce
compile times. However, these utilities provide a convenient way
to test the library and to learn its behavior, so their inclusion
is recommended if possible.

Appendix A. at the end of this file provides a full list of the
package components and their properties.


3. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx uses GNU Autotools so installation should be familiar to
veterans of free software. If your platform cannot easily run the
Autotools scripts (e.g., MS Visual Studio) then refer to the
appropriate platform-specific README.xxx located in this
directory for alternate instructions. *** also mention "project"
directory here ***

In theory the following 3 steps will compile and install libdmtx
on your system:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

However, you may need to install additional software for these
steps to work properly. Details are provided below to handle
error messages or if you want to customize beyond the defaults.

Details on "configure" step
----------------------------------------
If you obtained libdmtx from Subversion you may have received an
error like "./configure: No such file or directory". Run this
command and try again:

  $ ./autogen.sh

The autogen.sh command requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and
pkgconfig to be installed on your system.

The configure script offers many options for customizing the
build process, many of which are described in the INSTALL file in
this directory. If the INSTALL file does not exist then you may
need to run the "./autogen.sh" step first. Examples of common
customizations include:

  $ ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
  $ ./configure --prefix=/your/custom/path
  $ ./configure --disable-dmtxread --disable-dmtxwrite

Details on "make" step
----------------------------------------
Errors encountered during the "make" step are often a result of
missing software dependencies. These dependencies are listed in
Appendix A. of this file. Install any missing software and try
again.

Details on "sudo make install" step
----------------------------------------
If the 'sudo' command is not configured on your system then
alternatively you can yell "Yeeehaww!" as you log in as root and
run this instead:

  $ make install

And finally...
----------------------------------------
If you want to verify that everything is working properly you can
optionally build the test programs like this:

  $ make check

This command will not perform any tests, but will build the
programs that contain test logic: multi_test, rotate_test,
simple_test, and unit_test.

Note: multi_test and rotate_test contain extra dependencies due
to their graphical nature, and are not terribly useful unless you
need to test the library's internals.


4. Basic Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------

New users are encouraged to read the man pages for the library
and command line utilities. However, here are a few simple cases
to get you started:

The dmtxwrite utility turns a message into a barcode image. The
message is passed to dmtxwrite via file or standard input, and
the output image is written to file or standard output. The
following examples all produce an equivalent result:

  $ echo -n 123456 | dmtxwrite > image.png
  $ echo -n 123456 | dmtxwrite -o image.png
  $ echo -n 123456 > mesg.txt; dmtxwrite mesg.txt > image.png
  $ dmtxwrite <(echo -n 123456) -o image.png

Conversely, the dmtxread utility turns barcode images back into
messages. Images are passed to dmtxread via standard input or
file, and the output is written to standard output. The following
examples will produce an equivalent result:

  $ dmtxread -n image.png
  $ cat image.png | dmtxread -n

Other typical cases:

  $ dmtxread -n -N1 image1.png image2.png image3.png
  $ dmtxread -n -N1 -m500 image.png

You can even combine the utilities like this:

  $ echo 'Hello, world!' | dmtxwrite | dmtxread
  Hello, world!

  $ dmtxread image1.png | dmtxwrite -o image2.png

Note: In this example the barcode in image2.png might appear
different than the one in image1.png. Both barcodes will encode
the same message, but the overall barcode shape and its internal
bit pattern might be different.

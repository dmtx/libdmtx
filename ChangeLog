version 0.5 [April 2008]
  Error correction using libfec (thanks Florian!)
  Rework encoding and decoding API for consistency and intuitiveness
  Handle region detection and region decoding as separate tasks
  Pass found regions back to calling app before attempting decode
  Image mask approach (for performance and multi-barcode scans)
  Fix TestForEndOfSymbolEdifact() to handle special cases correctly
  Roll scan pattern into core library (inward breadth-first cross)
  Replace dmtxScanLine() with dmtxScanPixel()
  Implement 4-direction weighted module decisions (eliminates thresholds)
  Add ability to scan portion of image
  Add --diagnose option that dumps image with embedded scan infomation
  Added Z rotation angle (in degrees) to verbose output
  Move ASCII and codeword output to separate --preview option
  Added -R option for setting image print resolution in dpi (PNG only)
  Remove gltest and simpletest from default build target
  Update Subversion to be keyword friendly ($Id$)
  Updated documentation to reflect API and option changes

version 0.4 [December 2007]
  Remove arbitrary sz scaling (100.0) since it doesn't matter anyway
  Fix 4 bottom-right modules in sizes where they are not used (thanks Matthias R.!)
  Replace callback references with preprocessor macros
  Implement remaining encodation schemes for encoding (X12, Base 256, etc...)
  Implement remaining encodation schemes for decoding (X12, Base 256, etc...)
  Implement --auto-best option for best possible encoding efficiency
  Implement multi-region symbols
  Read and write rectangle barcodes
  Use GNU autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool)
  New region detection overhaul
  Include initial version of Python bindings from pydmtx project (thanks Dan!)
  Add decoding functionality through Python
  Add marathon images to project (thanks john@sportcam.net!)
  Fix dmtxread crash when same barcode is found more than 16 times
  Verbose messages describing traits of detected barcodes
  --codewords option to print codewords instead of decoded message
  --newline option to insert newline character at end of output
  Additional output formats (PNG, ASCII, codewords)
  'make test' executes regression tests for encodation

version 0.3 [October 2006]
  Several high-level changes: build process, naming consistency, file layout
  Added new automatic style checks in script directory ("make style")
  Implemented remaining encodation schemes for decode (X12, Base 256, etc...)
  Fixed instability/regressions that were introduced in v0.2 release
  Color sampling now averaged from multiple pixel locations
  Size calibration accuracy improved with new approach
  dmtxread: increased default scanline count, added multi-page TIFF format
  dmtxwrite: bug fixes, implemented -o option
  Improved documentation: deps listed in INSTALL, new man page for dmtxwrite

version 0.2 [June 2006]
  Cleaned up program structure surrounding decoding process
  Improved API for real-world use (no longer just dumping results to STDOUT)
  Added "dmtxread" command line utility
  Added "dmtxwrite" command line utility
  Implemented Reed-Solomon error detection
  Created "simpletest.c" for full circle processing test
  Now using libpng(3) in library to read Data Matrix images
  Improved documentation (somewhat)

version 0.1 [April 2006]
  Initial release

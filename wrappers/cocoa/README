README for libdmtx Cocoa wrapper version 0.6.1 - November 23, 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Installing libdmtx on GNU/Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is a general Cocoa wrapper that includes CocoaTouch, so it
can be used for iPhone/iPod Touch and general OS X development.
It was written by Stefan Hafeneger, who donated the code and made
it available under the LGPLv2.

This code provides a Cocoa class called SHDataMatrixReader.m,
which is a singleton with a wrapper function for decoding and an
image convert method (so there is no need for libpng). Notably,
it uses the official iPhone SDK so jailbreak is not required.

README for libdmtx-vala
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  libdmtx-vala is a Vala binding for libdmtx that was written by Evan
  Nemerson and is distributed as part of the libdmtx package.


1. libdmtx-php Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  Simply copy libdmtx.vapi into the directory where valac looks for
  vapis. This is ususally /usr/share/vala/vapi, but if you are unsure
  and vala is installed, you can use pkg-config to obtain the location
  by running `pkg-config --variable=vapidir vala-1.0`.

  If you do not wish to install the bindings globally, you can use
  valac's --vapidir argument instead.


2. Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  To use these bindings, you will need valac-0.7.6 or greater, and
  libdmtx-0.7.1 or greater.

3. Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  An example program, test.vala, is included with these bindings. This
  program will user Cairo to generate a PDF containing a data matrix
  barcode. To compile it, simply run:

    valac -o test --pkg libdmtx --pkg cairo test.vala

  Compiling any other libdmtx vala code is just as simple. Simply add
  --pkg libdmtx, and valac will handle the rest.
